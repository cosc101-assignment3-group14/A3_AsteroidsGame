### Description:
 Astroids is a classic multidirectional shooter arcade game. The player controls a space ship in an asteroid field, the aim being to survive as long as possible whilst shooting the asteroids to increase their score. UFO's will also attack the players space ship at random intervals. The game is divided into levels. The player starts with 3 lives. Upon reaching the next level the players ships lives are replenished if any have been lost. Points are awarded as follows:
 * 10 points for an asteroid hit
 * 100 points for destroying a UFO
 * 500 points for reaching a new level
